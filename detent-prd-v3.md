# Detent — Product Requirements Document
| | |
|---|---|
| Product | Detent: state-driven autonomous engineering, delivered as a Claude Code plugin |
| Version | 3.0-draft.6 |
| Date | 2026-08-18 |
| Status | Draft for review |
| Implementation | TypeScript (public, open source) |
| Supersedes | PRD v2.0-draft.7 (the CLI line; remains the reference for every section v3 inherits unchanged) |

> **Detent v3 — the plugin re-target.** Applies **PRDR-065**: Detent is re-targeted from a standalone npm CLI into a **native Claude Code plugin whose interactive loop is driven by the model**, over a deterministic **referee** that keeps every safety guarantee the v2 kernel enforced. The change rests on one structural idea — the **referee/driver split** — and records five decisions, **D-26…D-30**. It amends the delivery model (D-2), the architecture (ARCH-1/D-19), the command contract (P1/D-3/C-14), budget enforcement (P6), and the containment posture (D-22). It does **not** touch the twenty-state machine (§7), the verification adapter (§6), the filesystem contract (§5), branching (§9), or artifacts (§10): those are driver-agnostic and are **inherited unchanged from v2.0-draft.7** (see *Inheritance*, end of document). This is a major-version event under C-14, taken deliberately.

> **Reading guide.** Requirement ids carry over from v2 (`C-*` command, `F-*` filesystem, `V-*` verification, `X-*` execution machine, `S-*` sessions/SDK, `B-*` branch, `A-*` artifacts, `SEC-*` security, `N-*` non-functional), plus v3's `R-*` referee surface. **One global reconciliation applies to every inherited section: "the kernel" now reads "the referee."** The Python reference v0.1.3 remains the porting oracle for the inherited machine; v3's new surfaces (the referee MCP boundary, the plugin, the model-driven loop) have no oracle and are specified here directly.

## 1. Summary
Detent turns planning documents into merged, reviewed, test-gated code using fresh, single-purpose Claude sessions whose every consequential move is admitted by a **deterministic referee**. It ships two ways over **one shared referee**: a **Claude Code plugin** — the interactive default, where the model drives the loop through referee tools — and a **headless driver** — the retained deterministic loop, for CI and unattended runs. The public experience is unchanged: `init` prepares a project (discovers docs and verification entrypoints, generates a plan as tickets, obtains approval); `run` executes the approved plan through a budgeted implement → test → review loop with a research-gated escalation ladder and explicit human gates. All intermediate state persists in `.detent/`; both workflows resume from checkpoints when re-invoked, under either driver.

## 2. Product Principles
P1 **Two workflows, twenty states.** The internal machine may be arbitrarily rich; the public workflow is `init` → approve → `run` → done, surfaced as the plugin's commands and the five closed decisions. Interruptions resume by re-invoking the same workflow.
P2 **The referee trusts artifacts and exit codes, never prose.** No state transition occurs on an unverified model claim — under either driver, and whether the move was chosen by the deterministic loop or proposed by the model.
P3 **Project owns its tooling; Detent owns only bindings.** `.detent/` never contains project configuration (F-2).
P4 **An unexecuted anything is a guess.** Bindings, backends, and plans are exercised before they are relied on.
P5 **Deny by default; consent is explicit, per-action, and logged.**
P6 **Budgets are hard.** Every loop has a counter; every counter has a ceiling; every ceiling routes to a human. Under the model-driven driver, *hard* is enforced at the referee boundary, not by owning the loop: a billable session exists only through the metered referee tool, and ambient tool use that would bypass the ledger is denied by the containment hook (D-28).
P7 **Detent never writes to the user's base branch.** In any mode, under any driver — enforced by the containment hook, which runs on every tool call.
P8 **Knowledge compounds.** Failure signatures, research briefs, and quarantine tickets persist and are shared via the repo.
P9 **Stale state is unconsumable.** Every checkpoint is content-addressed to its inputs; resume is a referee property, identical under either driver (D-30).

## Decision Log (v3 additions)
D-1…D-25 carry forward from v2.0-draft.7. D-2, D-19, and D-22 are amended as below; P6 gains D-28.

| ID | Decision | Rationale (abridged) |
|---|---|---|
| D-26 | **Delivery is a Claude Code plugin (interactive) plus a retained headless driver (CI/unattended), over one shared referee.** Amends D-2's "npm-distributed": the plugin distributes via a marketplace; the headless driver remains an npm package. | PRDR-065; a plugin is the native home for the interactive planning/approval/monitoring experience, but N-7's self-build gate and the CI split need a headless entry point a model-driven loop does not provide — so both drivers are first-class. |
| D-27 | **The referee owns legality; drivers own sequencing.** Restates ARCH-1/D-19. "Decides what happens next" splits: *legality* (validate artifact, apply event, classify gate, admit transition, permit spend) is the referee's alone; *sequencing* (which legal move runs next) may be the model's. Model output still enters the referee only through §10 validators and gate results — an illegal request is **rejected, not applied**. | PRDR-065; preserves the property D-19 calls the single most important — no transition on an unverified claim — while allowing the model to choose among moves the referee has already deemed legal. |
| D-28 | **Budgets are enforced at the referee-tool + `PreToolUse`-hook boundary.** A billable session spawns only through the metered `R-4` `attempt` tool, which checks the ledger before and records after; the hook denies ambient billable tool use (a direct `Task` spawn, a direct gate-running `Bash`) that would bypass the ledger; overshoot is bounded at one in-flight session (inherits D-25). | PRDR-065 (OQ-A); with the model driving, "hard" cannot mean "the kernel is the only actor" — it means every spend path passes through a counter the hook makes unavoidable. |
| D-29 | **D-22 splits by driver.** `settingSources: []` is retained unchanged on the headless driver (it still constructs sessions directly). On the interactive plugin driver — which runs inside the user's configured Claude Code and cannot suppress loaded settings the same way — the D-21 `PreToolUse` hook is **authoritative over any allow rule a settings file introduces**, and referee legality never consults repo settings. | PRDR-065 (OQ-C); the isolation `settingSources: []` bought is preserved where available and backstopped by the hook where it is not. |
| D-30 | **Resume is a referee property, not a driver property.** Checkpoints in `.detent/` are written by the referee on every admitted transition and reload identically under either driver (C-8/C-9). Interactive redirection mid-loop reuses C-8 content-addressed invalidation; an abandoned interactive attempt resumes as a C-9 crash (stale claim, resumable pool). No new state. | PRDR-065 (OQ-D); the model-driven loop changes who picks the next move, not where state lives or how it is keyed. |

```

- **ARCH-1 Layer boundary (D-19, restated by D-27).** Agents and the driving model never own **legality**: sessions and the model produce **artifacts, telemetry, and move requests**; the referee alone validates artifacts, applies events, classifies gates, and admits transitions (P2). The model may own **sequencing** — which legal move runs next — but every request enters the referee exclusively through the §10 schema validators and gate results; **no model-issued request applies a transition, consumes a budget, or writes outside surface without a validator or gate result in between.** Mechanically: the referee's only driver-facing surface is the `R-*` tool set (§3b); session output enters through the §10 validators; `schemas/**` remains below every layer.
  *AC:* dependency-direction lint in CI — the referee imports no driver code and no SDK types beyond the backend interface; an audit test asserts **every `machine.apply` call site's event derives from a validator or gate result** (unchanged from v2, and true regardless of which driver called the tool); a second audit asserts every referee tool that mutates ticket or run state re-validates its precondition and is reachable by the model only as an MCP tool, never as an ambient capability.
- **ARCH-2 Referee is driver-agnostic (D-26/D-27).** The referee has no knowledge of which driver invoked it. Both drivers reach identical legality through the same `R-*` tools; a move legal under one is legal under the other. This is what lets the headless driver serve CI while the model-driven driver serves the interactive session, with one implementation of every guarantee.

## 3b. Referee surface (R)
- **R-1** The referee is a bundled MCP server. Every capability that reads or mutates run state is an MCP tool; there is no ambient path to legality. Tools: `next` (ready set), `claim` (atomic, X-3), `attempt` (spawn a metered billable session for a role), `record` (ingest a validated artifact/gate result → event), `gate` (run + classify a bound gate), `transition` (admit an X-3 event), `status`/`report` (read-only). Each mutating tool re-validates against the machine before acting.
  *AC:* a fixture that calls `transition` with an event the current state does not admit is refused with the current state named, no checkpoint written; the model cannot reach `machine.apply` except through a tool that gate- or validator-derives the event.
- **R-2** Sequencing requests are advisory; legality is dispositive. The model calls `next`, picks one ready ticket, calls `claim`; a claim the machine does not admit is refused. The model never observes an illegal move as available.
  *AC:* two-ready-ticket fixture — the model may claim either; a claim on a blocked ticket is refused naming the blocker.
- **R-3** The referee persists every admitted transition to `.detent/` (F-1) before returning success, so resume (D-30) is independent of the driver's liveness.
  *AC:* kill the interactive session mid-`attempt`; re-invoking `run` resumes from the last admitted transition, the stale claim reclaimable per C-9.
- **R-4** `attempt` is the sole billable path (D-28): it checks the run and per-slot ledgers before spawning, refuses over-ceiling with the human-routing outcome P6 requires, and records tokens/cost on return. The containment hook denies any ambient tool the model could use to spawn or run gate-work outside `attempt`.
  *AC:* over-budget fixture — `attempt` refuses and routes to a human; a direct ambient `Task` spawn for Detent work is hook-denied; the ledger sums every session that ran.

---

## 4. Command Contract (C, v3)
- **C-2′ (draft.2, PRDR-066).** C-2's discovery families gain an infix prd family —
  `*prd*.md` / `*prd*.txt`, case-insensitive on the token — so a `<product>-prd*.md`
  planning document is discoverable. Found by T-140's first live firing: N-7 names
  `detent-prd-v3.md`, which the prefix-only families could not see; the heuristics move
  toward the contract, the document keeps the name D-20 fixed.

The `init` pipeline (§4.1 of v2) is **inherited unchanged** in its phases and interrupts — `INIT_FS → DISCOVER → [AWAIT_DOCS] → ANALYZE → [AWAIT_INFO] → DETERMINE_VERIFICATION → [AWAIT_BINDING_CHOICE | AWAIT_SETUP_CONSENT] → PLAN → PREPARE_AGENTS → PRESENT → [AWAIT_APPROVAL] → READY` — and re-surfaced as plugin commands and skills. C-1…C-8 hold verbatim (with "kernel" → "referee"). v3 restates only the surface and the loop ownership:

- **C-1′** `init` and `run` are the plugin's two commands (`/detent:init`, `/detent:run`), and Detent registers skills so the model invokes the right phase from natural intent ("plan this repo", "keep going"). The headless driver exposes the same two as the retained CLI verbs. C-1's git-root rule and the five C-5 interrupts are unchanged; interrupts are surfaced as the plugin's **presented decisions**, still a closed set of five.
  *AC:* the plugin manifest registers exactly two commands; a docs test asserts the five-decision closed set; subdirectory invocation still exits/《presents》 the root hint with no `.detent/` created.
- **C-9′…C-13′** `run` semantics (execute only an approved plan; atomic claims; resumable pool; escalation handling; exit codes; user-facing vocabulary) are inherited. Under the **model-driven driver**, the loop is: `next` → `claim` → `attempt` → `record`/`gate` → `transition`, chosen by the model, admitted by the referee. Under the **headless driver**, the same sequence is chosen deterministically. C-11 exit codes remain public API for the headless driver; the plugin surfaces the same four outcomes as presented states.
  *AC:* the oracle crash-resume class ports green under the headless driver; an interactive-abandon fixture resumes identically (D-30); both drivers produce byte-identical `transitions.jsonl` for the same admitted sequence.
- **C-14′ Porcelain freeze (major-version).** The golden path is exactly the two workflows and the five closed decisions, now surfaced as the two plugin commands and their presented interrupts. Adding a command or a decision class is a major-version decision requiring a PRD amendment. The v2→v3 re-target is itself such a decision, recorded here (D-26).
  *AC:* release-checklist item; a docs test asserts the two-command, five-decision plugin surface.

*(C-6/C-6a setup-consent, C-7 approval, C-8 replay, C-10 escalation, C-12 plumbing, C-13 vocabulary: inherited from v2 §4, reconciled "kernel"→"referee". C-12 plumbing commands become read-only referee tools / plugin subcommands; claim discipline is unchanged.)*

## 8. Sessions & Agent SDK Integration (S, v3)
S-1…S-7 are inherited from v2 §8, reconciled to the two drivers:
- **S-1′ (draft.3, PRDR-067).** An artifact-producing read-only session runs
  `permissionMode: "default"` with its read-only tool surface plus exactly one scoped
  write rule, `Write(//<artifact_out>)` (S-3's specifier mechanism; `doctor` arbitrates an
  unrecognized form). Plan mode remains for artifact-less sessions (doctor's smoke).
  Read-only-ness is the allowlist plus the D-21 hook, not a mode that contradicts P2's
  artifact interface. Found by T-140's first live read-only session.
- **S-2′/D-21** Containment is the `PreToolUse` hook under **both** drivers — the headless driver wires it when constructing sessions; the plugin ships it as a plugin hook. It denies outside `surface[]`, denies protected globs, preserves the surface-expansion lever, and (D-28) denies ledger-bypassing ambient billable tools. A hook deny binds over every allow rule and permission mode.
- **S-2″ (draft.5, PRDR-068).** The D-21 surface check governs MUTATION: the mutating
  tools (Write/Edit/MultiEdit/NotebookEdit) are denied outside `surface[]` and denied on
  protected globs (SEC-3 is immutability, not unreadability); non-mutating path'd calls
  are allowed anywhere INSIDE the worktree, and the outside-worktree boundary (P7) holds
  for every tool. Found by T-140: a worker denied READING the PRD's §10 — its own
  specification — shipped an empty diff that only the D-6 review layer caught. Driver-mode
  policy unchanged (D-27: the driver neither reads nor writes files).
- **OQ-2 resolved (draft.6, PRDR-074).** The license is **MIT** — chosen by the user
  2026-08-20 during T-141 publish preparation. v2 posed MIT vs Apache-2.0 as the sole
  M4 blocker; MIT matches the header's "public, open source" delivery and the plugin
  ecosystem's norm. `LICENSE` at the repo root is the operative text; the v2 document
  stays frozen with the question as it stood.
- **S-3′** Per-role tool allowlists define the role surface; containment is the hook, never the allowlist (unchanged from PRDR-050).
- **D-22/D-29** Setting-source isolation splits by driver: `settingSources: []` retained headless; on the plugin the hook is authoritative over loaded settings, and referee legality never consults repo settings.

## 11. Security & Supply Chain (SEC, v3)
SEC-1…SEC-5 inherited. v3 adds the in-session threat answer:
- **SEC-6 In-session policy (D-29).** Running inside the user's Claude Code, the plugin cannot rely on empty setting sources to neutralize an attacker-authored project settings file. The containment hook is therefore normative and authoritative: it evaluates before, and overrides, any allow rule a loaded settings file introduces, and referee legality is independent of settings entirely. A settings file can only *narrow* what Detent may do, never widen it.
  *AC:* a fixture project ships a settings file allow-listing an out-of-surface write; the hook denies it; `transitions.jsonl` records no transition.

## 13. Milestones (v3)
The v2 milestones (M0…M4) delivered the CLI line and its 52-test oracle parity; they are complete through M3 and are the referee's provenance. v3 adds the plugin series **MP0…MP4**, each with its own exit:

- **MP0 — the referee.** Extract the v2 kernel behind the R-* MCP server; the headless driver drives it to full parity with today's `run` (same `transitions.jsonl`, same oracle tests green). *Exit:* the headless driver over the referee passes the entire v2 suite unchanged.
- **MP1 — the plugin skeleton.** Manifest, the two commands, vendored subagents, the D-21 hook wired as a plugin hook. *Exit:* `/detent:init` and `/detent:run` load; the hook denies an out-of-surface write in a live session.
- **MP2 — the model-driven loop.** `run` driven by the model over R-* tools; the D-28 budget hook; D-29 hook authority. *Exit:* a multi-ticket run completes under the model driver with byte-identical transitions to the headless driver, budgets provably hard (over-budget fixture routes to a human; ambient bypass denied).
- **MP3 — init as a plugin.** The seven phases and five decisions surfaced as commands/skills/presented interrupts. *Exit:* the golden-path docs test passes against the plugin surface.
- **MP4 — self-build + distribution (N-7).** The headless driver self-builds v3 in CI (the permanent gate, D-16); the plugin publishes to a marketplace. *Exit:* N-7 green on the v3 document; marketplace install smoke-tested.

**N-7 scoping note (draft.4, raised by the self-build's own analyst — T-140).** The walking skeleton N-7 builds is the referee core and the headless driver (the MP0-equivalent of this document): a deterministic machine whose gates run green. The plugin shell and marketplace distribution are post-skeleton milestones; their platform-authoring and publish mechanics are plan-time research topics (C-3a) or later tickets' concerns, and are **never blocking questions for the skeleton plan** — an analyst reading this document should plan the skeleton first and defer those surfaces to their milestones.

---

## Inheritance (unchanged from v2.0-draft.7)
The following sections are **driver-agnostic** and are inherited verbatim from `detent-prd-v2.md`, with the single reconciliation "kernel" → "referee":
- **§3 Scope & Non-Goals** — including NG7 (Claude Code remains the only backend; a plugin *is* Claude Code, so NG7 is reinforced, not weakened).
- **§5 Filesystem Contract (F)** — `.detent/` layout, the committed set, content-addressed checkpoints (F-4). **F-1′ (draft.4, PRDR-066/PRDR-064 applied):** the local set gains the two D-21 hook-policy files (`active_surface.json`, `stage.json` — run-level, never committed); and the plan directory is `plan/` (tickets `<ticket-id>.json`, plus the plan artifact `plan.json` and the approval record `approval.json`) — a file in `plan/` is a ticket **iff** its name is not one of the reserved names `plan.json` and `approval.json`; the reserved set is closed, and a reader that enumerates the directory asserts against it rather than carrying its own list. This is A-2's stated home, raised unprompted by the N-7 analyst reading this document (T-140).
- **§6 Verification Adapter Contract (V)** — discovery, binding, execution, drift.
- **§7 Execution State Machine (X)** — the twenty states, the X-3 transition table, the escalation ladder, the budgets of X-1, `GATE_DRIFT` (D-23), attempt generations (D-17). The referee *is* this machine; nothing in it changes.
- **§9 Branch & Merge Contract (B)**, **§10 Artifacts (A)**, **§12 Non-Functional (N)** — including N-7 self-build, now naming `detent-prd-v3.md` as its target — **§14 Metrics**, **§15 Risks**.

Where an inherited section says the CLI is the entry point, read "the headless driver or the plugin"; where it says "the kernel decides", read "the referee admits, the driver sequences" (D-27). No inherited requirement's *semantics* change; only the delivery surface and the loop's driver do.
